By investigating its dynamical, thermal, and mechanical properties, we find that ${\\mathrm{SnO}}_{2}$ monolayer is an auxetic material with a large in-plane negative Poisson's ratio. Furthermore, our results show that ${\\mathrm{SnO}}_{2}$ is an indirect-gap semiconductor with a band gap in the region of 3.7 eV and an extremely high electron mobility, $\\ensuremath{\\sim}{10}^{3}\\phantom{\\rule{4pt}{0ex}}{\\mathrm{cm}}^{2}\\phantom{\\rule{0.16em}{0ex}}{\\mathrm{V}}^{\\ensuremath{-}1}\\phantom{\\rule{0.16em}{0ex}}{\\mathrm{s}}^{\\ensuremath{-}1}$. Interestingly, the band structure of ${\\mathrm{SnO}}_{2}$ presents double Mexican-hat-like band edges in the valence bands near the Fermi level. Due to such a unique band feature, a ferromagnetic phase transition takes place with a half-metallic ground state that can be induced by hole doping within a very wide concentration range. Such a magnetic phase can be well explained by the Stoner mechanism. A peculiar feature of the magnetic state is the presence of large magnetocrystalline anisotropy that can switch from in-plane to out-of-plane upon hole doping. Hence, ${\\mathrm{SnO}}_{2}$ monolayer can be tuned to be either an $XY$ magnet or an Ising one, with a magnetic critical temperature above room temperature at proper hole concentrations. These findings demonstrate that the predicted phase of ${\\mathrm{SnO}}_{2}$ is a rare example of $p$-type magnetism and a possible candidate for spintronic applications.","venue":"","journal":{"name":"Physical Review B","volume":"102","pages":"195408"},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Physics","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Materials Science","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Physics","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":1,"scimago_score":1.345,"scimago_h_index":497,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a2c3676aff95a4f19e3620f00a86e9bb2b43820"}

Only few case series/reports have reported the outcomes of pregnancies in patients with PNH despite the increased risk of thrombosis. Similarly, there is limited knowledge regarding the effect of the approved treatments on conception and pregnancy outcomes. Here, we report the first series of pregnancies in PNH patients from the Middle Eastern region from our tertiary care hospital. Ten pregnancies in four females after diagnosis with PNH were identified. In terms of PNH management, only eculizumab was used, as the safety of ravulizumab use in pregnancies has not yet been established. In the antepartum period, the patients had variable symptoms that ranged from mild symptoms including epistaxis, tea-colored urine and vaginal bleeding to life-threatening vessel thrombosis. Further, red blood cell and platelet transfusions were required because of bleeding and hemolysis in four pregnancies. The pregnancy outcomes varied, but based on these, the safety of eculizumab use during pregnancy remained inconclusive. The postpartum period was complicated in one case by portal vein thrombosis and was managed accordingly. In conclusion, pregnant females with PNH are at an increased risk for complications due to PNH, and thus experienced hematologists and obstetricians should be involved jointly in their care.","venue":"Saudi Journal of Medicine and Medical Sciences","journal":{"name":"Saudi Journal of Medicine & Medical Sciences","volume":"9","pages":"178 - 189"},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Medicine","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/19103704100551f898b158dd9156ea37f1d1977c"}

Combining the remarkable optical properties of quantum dots (QDs) with the electrical properties of quantum wells (QWs) allows for the formation of hybrid devices which can utilize NRET as a means of transferring absorbed optical energy from the QDs to the QW. Here we report on plasmon-enhanced NRET from semiconductor nanocrystal QDs to a QW. Ag nanoparticles in the form of colloids and ordered arrays are used to demonstrate plasmon-mediated NRET from QDs to QWs with varying top barrier thicknesses. Plasmon-mediated energy transfer (ET) efficiencies of up to â¼25% are observed with the Ag colloids. The distance dependence of the plasmon-mediated ET is found to follow the same dâ4 dependence as the direct QD to QW ET. There is also evidence for an increase in the characteristic distance of the interaction, thus indicating that it follows a FÃ¶rster-like model with the Ag nanoparticle-QD acting as an enhanced donor dipole. Ordered Ag nanoparticle arrays display plasmon-mediated ET efficiencies up to â¼21%. To explore the tunability of the array system, two arrays with different geometries are presented. It is demonstrated that changing the geometry of the array allows a transition from overall quenching of the acceptor QW emission to enhancement, as well as control of the competition between the QD donor quenching and ET rates.","venue":"Nanotechnology","journal":{"name":"Nanotechnology","volume":"28","pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Materials Science","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Physics","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"},{"category":"Physics","source":"external"},{"category":"Materials Science","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":2,"scimago_score":0.631,"scimago_h_index":228,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c66c6a726feb975062cd7bbf9e4637de68a4d041"}

The aims of this study were: (i) to measure the response rate among women not attending organized cytological screening who were offered a device for self-sampling a vaginal smear at home; (ii) to examine the prevalence of high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) among women performing self-sampling. Women aged 35-50 years, who had not participated in organized cytological screening for more than 6 years, were offered the opportunity to collect vaginal samples at home using a self-sampling device (Qvintip). The material collected was analysed for high-risk HPV using the Hybrid Capture 2 method. Of 369 women included in the study, 179 (49%) ordered the self-sampling device and 117 (32%) performed self-sampling at home and sent the sample to our laboratory for analysis. The mean prevalence of high-risk HPV was 26% (30/117), 31% (25/80) in women aged 35-42 years and 14% (5/37) in women aged 43-50 years. There was no significant difference in the participation rate with regard to age. The prevalence of high-risk HPV in women not covered by organized screening was considerably higher than in the general population; therefore they may represent a category at high risk of cervical cancer.

We propose that an insiderâs perspective affords a view of stigmatized groups as actively seeking to make sense of their social world and attain positive outcomes, not simply avoid negative outcomes. In this sense, an insiderâs perspective acknowledges that stigmatized groups are not simply victims or passive recipients of stereotyping but rather actively attempt to construct a buffering life space. The literature on stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination has typically focused on the ways dominant groups negatively view and respond to minority groups, illustrating the extent, pervasiveness, and influence of negative attitudes and stereotypes on information processing, memory, judgment, and emotional response of dominant group members.

This study aimed to compare positive mental health between elderly and young earthquake survivors. Method Data for this study, consisting of 324 earthquake survivors, were obtained from a population-based cross-sectional survey conducted in Iran, 2015. The long-term effect of earthquake was assessed using the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form questionnaire. A one-way multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) using SPSS (version 22) was used in data analysis. Results Older adults scored significantly a higher level of overall positive mental health (mean [M]=34.31, standard deviation [SD]=10.52) than younger age group (M=27.48, SD=10.56, t=â4.41; P<0.001). Results of MANCOVA revealed a statistically significant difference between older and young adults on the combined positive mental health subscales (F(3,317)=6.95; P<0.001), after controlling for marital status, sex, and employment status.

The development of retrograde monosynaptic tracing vectors has enabled visualization of the presynaptic sources onto defined sets of postsynaptic neurons. Here, we describe the first application of a novel viral tracer, based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which directs retrograde transsynaptic viral spread between defined cell types. We use this virus in the mouse retina to show connectivity between starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and their known synaptic partners, direction-selective retinal ganglion cells, as well as to discover previously unknown connectivity between SACs and other retinal ganglion cell types. These novel connections were confirmed using physiological recordings. VSV transsynaptic tracing enables cell type-specific dissection of neural circuitry and can reveal synaptic relationships among neurons that are otherwise obscured due to the complexity and density of neuropil.","venue":"Journal of Neuroscience","journal":{"name":"The Journal of Neuroscience","volume":"33","pages":"35 - 51"},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Biology","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"},{"category":"Biology","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":null,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b9420dfefe6df1ef5251eecddbb2e3ab7f7f4fb0"}

The protein complex secreted from their body and used to attach their calcareous shell to almost all surfaces in water has long fascinated us because we have limited technology with which to attach materials in water. Unraveling the mechanism of underwater attachment by barnacles is thus important for interface science, for the understanding of the biology and physiology of barnacles, and for the development of technology to prevent fouling. Previous studies have indicated that the intermolecular interactions optimized by conformations of the adhesive proteins are crucial in the self-assembly and/or curing of the adhesive. This study aimed to identify the possible structural determinants responsible for the self-assembly. Thioflavin T binding screening of peptides designed on the basis of the primary structure of a bulk 52 kDa cement protein indicated the presence of some amyloidogenic motifs in the protein. The conformation of the peptide was transformed to a Î²-sheet by an increase in either pH or ionic strength, resulting in its self-assembly. Thioflavin T binding was inhibited by small polyphenolic molecules, suggesting the contribution of aromatic interactions during self-assembly. The occurrence of amyloid-like units in the protein implies that the protein conformation is an important factor contributing to the self-assembly of the cement, the first event of the curing, as the adhesive material is secreted into the seawater out of the animal's body.","venue":"Biochemistry","journal":{"name":"Biochemistry","volume":"54 3","pages":"\n          826-35\n        "},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Environmental Science","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Materials Science","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Biology","source":"external"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":1,"scimago_score":1.042,"scimago_h_index":274,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4a91e0c057868d409438650fca7460589cada91d"}

Variations in CaP composition can lead to different dissolution/precipitation behavior and may also affect the bone response. In the present study calcium pyrophosphate and hydroxylapatite coatings were successfully prepared by RF magnetron sputtering deposition. The phase composition, morphological properties, and the dissolution in SBF were characterized by using XRD, FTIR, EDS, SEM, and spectrophotometry. The results showed that all the sputtered coatings were amorphous and changed into a crystal structure after IR-radiation. The temperature for the crystallization of the amorphous coatings is lower for the hydroxylapatite coating (550 degrees C), compared to the calcium pyrophosphate coating (650 degrees C). All sputtered amorphous coatings were instable in SBF and dissolved partially within 4 wks of incubation. The heat-treated coatings appeared to be stable after incubation. These results showed that magnetron sputtering of calcium pyrophosphate coating is a promising method for forming a biocompatible ceramic coating.","venue":"Journal of Biomedical Materials Research.

The understanding of substance P has evolved beyond the original concept as the pain transmitter of the dorsal horn. Animal and genetic research, recent developments of nonpeptide substance P antagonists, and important changes in the understanding of neurotransmission have each contributed to the current understanding of substance P. After 7 decades, the physiologic role of substance P is known as a modulator of nociception, involved in signaling the intensity of noxious or aversive stimuli. Genetic studies in mice and development of substance P antagonists provide more recent results that support the redefinition of the central role of substance P. Evidence suggests that this neuropeptide is an integral part of central nervous system pathways involved in psychologic stress.","venue":"Pharmacotherapy","journal":{"name":"Pharmacotherapy: The Journal of Human Pharmacology and Drug Therapy","volume":"21","pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Medicine","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Biology","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82064b0d2d0d280f7dd42df077b7fb4dd424cedb"}

{"corpusid":33239565,"title":"Online attention modification for social anxiety disorder: replication of a randomized controlled trial","abstract":"Abstract Social anxiety disorder (SAD) models posit vigilance for external social threat cues and exacerbated self-focused attention as key in disorder development and maintenance. Evidence indicates a modified dot-probe protocol may reduce symptoms of SAD; however, the efficacy when compared to a standard protocol and long-term maintenance of treatment gains remains unclear. Furthermore, the efficacy of such protocols on SAD-related constructs remains relatively unknown. The current investigation clarified these associations using a randomized control trial replicating and extending previous research. Participants with SAD (n = 113; 71% women) were randomized to complete a standard (i.e. control) or modified (i.e. active) dot-probe protocol consisting of 15-min sessions twice weekly for four weeks. Self-reported symptoms were measured at baseline, post-treatment, and 4-month and 8-month follow-ups. Hierarchical linear modeling indicated significant self-reported reductions in symptoms of social anxiety, fear of negative evaluation, trait anxiety, and depression, but no such reductions in fear of positive evaluation. Symptom changes did not differ based on condition and were maintained at 8-month follow-up. Attentional biases during the dot-probe task were not related to symptom change. Overall, our results replicate support for the efficacy of both protocols in reducing symptoms of SAD and specific related constructs, and suggest a role of exposure, expectancy, or practice effects, rather than attention modification, in effecting such reductions. The current results also support distinct relationships between fears of negative and positive evaluation and social anxiety. Further research focused on identifying the mechanisms of change in attention modification protocols appears warranted.","venue":"Cognitive Behaviour Therapy","journal":{"name":"Cognitive Behaviour Therapy","volume":"46","pages":"44 - 59"},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Psychology","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Psychology","source":"external"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":1,"scimago_score":1.767,"scimago_h_index":73,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f4dd44232811e69418085025dddd83d1be0851cd"}

It is achieved through the introduction of multiple evidence-based perioperative measures that aim to diminish postoperative organ dysfunction while facilitating recovery. This review aims to present consensus recommendations for the optimal perioperative management of patients undergoing thoracic surgery (principally lung resection). A systematic review of meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, large non-randomized studies and reviews was conducted for each protocol element. Smaller prospective and retrospective cohort studies were considered only when higher-level evidence was unavailable. The quality of the evidence base was graded by the authors and used to form consensus recommendations for each topic. Development of these recommendations was endorsed by the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery Society and the European Society for Thoracic Surgery. Recommendations were developed for a total of 45 enhanced recovery items covering topics related to preadmission, admission, intraoperative care and postoperative care. Most are based on good-quality studies. In some instances, good-quality data were not available, and subsequent recommendations are generic or based on data extrapolated from other specialties. In other cases, no recommendation can currently be made because either equipoise exists or there is a lack of available evidence. Recommendations are based not only on the quality of the evidence but also on the balance between desirable and undesirable effects. Key recommendations include preoperative counselling, nutritional screening, smoking cessation, prehabilitation for high-risk patients, avoidance of fasting, carbohydrate loading, avoidance of preoperative sedatives, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, prevention of hypothermia, short-acting anaesthetics to facilitate early emergence, regional anaesthesia, nausea and vomiting control, opioid-sparing analgesia, euvolemic fluid management, minimally invasive surgery, early chest drain removal, avoidance of urinary catheters and early mobilization after surgery. These guidelines outline recommendations for the perioperative management of patients undergoing lung surgery based on the best available evidence. As the recommendation grade for most of the elements is strong, the use of a systematic perioperative care pathway has the potential to improve outcomes after surgery.","venue":"European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery","journal":{"name":"European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery","volume":"55","pages":"91â115"},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Medicine","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":1,"scimago_score":0.974,"scimago_h_index":153,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18e8a267a043a6f64303c36c2fffcb59a10d09b7"}

The shear strain distribution on the interphase of the lap joint specimens was measured by a digital image correlation technique. The results showed that the average shear strain along the bond line on the interphase was 1.94Ã10-3 when the specimen had lathe checks. Sealing treatment can thus reduce the average shear strain effectively. Soy-protein adhesive seemed to have the greatest ability to decrease the average shear strain along the bond line, from 1.94Ã10-3 to 0.94Ã10-3. In contrast, gelatinized starch appeared to decrease the strain slightly to 1.61Ã10-3. Average shear strain along the bond line of specimens treated with gelatinized starch/wood flour mixture was 1.00Ã10-3, which was between the values of the other two sealants. Dry shear strength of samples treated by GS and SPA increased from 7.6 MPa to 9.65 MPa and 8.85 MPa, respectively. The mixture of GSWF decreased the strength to 6.32 MPa.

Aim and methods The results of a 3-year collaborative project between WHO and the European Commission on progress achieved by Member States in implementing resolution EUR/RC55/R9 and the European Council Recommendation on the prevention of injuries are presented. A web-based database of country profiles was developed using a questionnaire survey completed by health ministry focal persons for injury and violence prevention. Information was provided on progress in delivering on key items of resolution EUR/RC55/R9 and on the implementation of 99 selected evidence-based programmes to prevent unintentional injury and violence and on the cross-cutting risk factors of alcohol and socioeconomic inequalities. Results There were responses from 47 of the 51 Member States with focal persons. Good progress is taking place, and resolution EUR/RC55/R9 has catalysed change in 75% of respondent countries. Development of national policies for individual types of injury and violence varied from 95% for road safety to 40% for preventing drowning. Implementation of evidence-based programmes for preventing all types of injury and violence varied in countries, and the median score was 73% for all these together. Conclusions This project reports that the health sector needs to commit more to the widespread implementation of effective programmes both in number and coverage, and to engage with other stakeholders in a multisectoral response to prevent injuries and violence.","venue":"Injury Prevention","journal":{"name":"Injury Prevention","volume":"16","pages":"A106 - A107"},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Medicine","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":null,"scimago_quartile":1,"scimago_score":0.898,"scimago_h_index":93,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/23fe44434689e93b4da5485d269cf0c791b61d17"}

{"corpusid":82897382,"title":"On adaptive radiation in gulls (tribe Larini)","abstract":"In 1930 Professor Boschma, then Head of the Leiden Department of Zoology, generously allowed one of his undergraduates to spend an entire spring away from the laboratory, observing the love rituals of Terns. He even accepted the rather incoherent account this young man wrote of his observations as part of the work to be submitted for his \"doctoraal\" examination. I very much doubt if at that time he expected his pupil ever to develop an interest in taxonomy and systematics. I hope that this paper will show that one should never give up hope. Even though I cannot claim to have become a taxonomist, some of the results of our comparative studies of gull behaviour begin to have a bearing on classification, and beyond that on its evolutionary interpretation. This work started as an attempt to unravel the interaction between individuals on which the social organisation of a breeding colony of Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus Pont.) is based (Tinbergen, 1936, 1953). Under the influence of Whitman's comparative studies of the behaviour of pigeons (1919), and Heinroth's (1911) and Lorenz's (1941) comparative studies of Anatidae, and particularly at the personal urging of Jan Verwey and Konrad Lorenz, I started, upon my arrival in Oxford in 1949, a co-operative programme of comparative behaviour studies in gulls, in which, at one time or another, the following persons took part: P.

Usnea trullifera Nyl. has been reported from East Africa (Motyka 1936-38), but the supporting specimen is presumed lost (in B); the type was from Tahiti and is in BM. Though the branches are strongly tuberculate and lack isidia, the plant is much smaller and is sparsely branched with well-developed fibrils. Both in habit, with its apical apothecia, and in its stramineous colour it is close to U.firmula. None of these species is known to produce psoromic acid, but it must be borne in mind that Usnea species commonly have more than one chemical strain, so that a strain with this chemistry in one of the hitherto known species may await detection. Usnea antiqua is so far known only from Tanzania, where it has been collected at three localities in the West Usambara Mountains at 1600-2000 m alt.","venue":"The Lichenologist","journal":{"name":"The Lichenologist","volume":"18","pages":"295 - 296"},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Biology","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Biology","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":null,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd7b6b4be951cd239a490278fa0fde068817a0a4"}

In the presence of the 1-olefin, the catalytic activity increases. As expected, the amount of 1-olefin inserted in the polymer chain depends on the monomers molar ratio in the polymerization bath. The molecular weight of the copolymer decreases as the concentration of the 1-olefin increases owing to the relatively easy chain transfer reactions after primary and secondary 1-olefin. The average ethylene sequence length decreases as the amount of inserted 1-olefin increases leading to a decrease of the melting temperature, T m . The crystallinity of polymers with the same 1-olefin content seems to be lower increasing the length of the 1-olefin.

The nature of the ice formed by each method depends on both the sucrose concentration and the specimen thickness. In order to compare the two methods, we mainly studied specimens having a thickness of 0.2âmm. Under these conditions, freezing by immersion gives rise to hexagonal (IH), cubic (IC) and amorphous (IV) ices when the sucrose concentration (weight/weight) has a value within the range 0â30%, 30â60%, 60% and higher, respectively. The temperature of the phase transitions IVâIC, ICâIH depends on the sucrose concentration. Highâpressure freezing gives rise to two specific forms of ice: an amorphous and a crystalline ice (ice III). Ice III is observed when pure water samples are highâpressure frozen provided that the sample temperature does not rise above â150âÂ°C. Above this temperature, ice III transforms into hexagonal ice. Amorphous ice is formed when the sucrose concentration is higher than 20%. The amorphous ice formed under high pressure has a similar, but not identical, Xâray diffraction pattern to that of amorphous ice formed at atmospheric pressure. While the Xâray diffraction pattern of amorphous ice formed at atmospheric pressure (IV) shows a broad ring at a position corresponding to 0.37ânm, that of highâpressure amorphous ice (IVHP) shows a broader ring, located at 0.35ânm. IVHP presents a phase transition (IVHPâIV) at temperatures that depend on the sucrose concentration. We also observed that some precautions have to be taken in order to minimize the alcohol contamination of highâpressure frozen samples. The iceâphase diagram presented in this paper should be taken into account in all methods dedicated to the structural study of frozen biological specimens.","venue":"","journal":{"name":"Journal of Microscopy","volume":"187","pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Materials Science","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Chemistry","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Materials Science","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":2,"scimago_score":0.567,"scimago_h_index":122,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa84f73640197fe09c47ab202fcefaf0d220534a"}

Experiments show that it can detect small changes in the particle-size distribution. Such a monitoring method is useful to give an early warning of the onset of agglomeration in a fluidized bed. In contrast to earlier methods, this method is insensitive to small changes in superficial gas velocity and can handle multiple signals, making it relevant to industrial application. By carefully choosing the measurement position, the method becomes also insensitive to small bed mass variations. It uses the attractor reconstructed from a measured pressure signal, which is a fingerprint of the hydrodynamics of the fluidized bed for a certain set of conditions. Using this method statistically the reconstructed attractor of a reference time series of pressure fluctuations (representing the desired fluidization behavior) is compared with that of successive time series measured during the bed operation.","venue":"","journal":{"name":"Aiche Journal","volume":"46","pages":"2183-2197"},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Engineering","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Engineering","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":null,"scimago_quartile":1,"scimago_score":0.734,"scimago_h_index":188,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bd3a28df3fb56845758859696c576e7d6f353f89"}

We assume that the walk started at a fixed vertex of the graph satisfies the invariance principle as in Yadin and Yehudayoff [16] in which the convergence of LERW to a radial SLE is established in this setting. Our main concern is chordal case, where a random walk is started at a boundary vertex of a simply connected grid domain and conditioned to exit it through another boundary vertex specified in advance. The primary contribution of the present paper is an estimate, which states that the excursion of the conditioned walk leaves an intrinsic neighborhood of its initial point not 'along' the boundary but through an intrinsic interior of the domain with high probability. Based on this result we give a proof for the convergence to the chordal SLE, a result that has recently been proved by Suzuki [12] under an analyticity assumption on the boundary of the domain arising in the limit.","venue":"","journal":{"name":"arXiv: Probability","volume":"","pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Mathematics","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Mathematics","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":null,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d99f412318c1709ac9a371095153136de330c07a"}

Much of the excess phosphorus has been sequestered into the sediments. Sediment water interactions, including diffusive fluxes and sediment resuspension are a source of available phosphorus for phytoplankton. As a consequence, nutrient-enriched lake water have led to phytoplankton blooms. These blooms are quantified by measurement of chlorophyll-a concentrations. While the in-situ water quality monitoring is time-consuming and costly, multispectral remote sensing sensors onboard satellites can detect chlorophyll-a contained in most phytoplankton efficiently.

In this thesis I present the design of a cold-biased system that controls the temperature of the irnager through passive cooling and active heating. The temperature is controlled by the system being heated to a slightly higher temperature than it's environment. The active control over the heater maintains the system at the target temperature within the 30 millikelvin range, with the best performance of 5 millikelvin control. The temperature control system can be used at various phases of ExoplanetSat development, including laboratory simulation of the temperature control of the ExoplanetSat imager during orbit night, characterizing the temperature response of any potential imager, and part of the design can be applied to the flight model of the prototype of ExoplanetSat for irnager ternperature control.","venue":"","journal":{"name":"","volume":"","pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Engineering","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Physics","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Geography","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":null,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4406de419056c74a54ff5a61415c379cdab115b2"}

{"corpusid":141091477,"title":"Teacher Assessment of Homework","abstract":"Abstract This study examined the perceptions of 247 teachers about potential helpful and harmful effects of homework on the students. In addition, they were asked to respond to eight questions about the efficacy of their homework assignments. Results indicated that teachers in this study had beliefs about the benefits of homework that were consistent with the literature, namely, that homework helped their students through reinforcement and review. They also expressed concern that homework might lead to frustrations, stress, lack of family time, and reduced time to play and experience life as a child. Finally, every teacher responded that they and their schools had never undertaken a study to determine the efficacy of homework. Introduction Homework is an inevitable part of every student's life from September through June. It is assigned for a number of reasons ranging from reinforcement and practice to developing character and skills (Cooper, 1989). It is often used as a factor in determining grades at the end of each academic term and it is considered a basic part of education in general (Kralovec and Buell, 2000). As Roderique et al., (1994) note, homework's importance is attested to in that school districts have policies regulating everything from how much time per grade-level should be allotted, how to involve parents, and when and where homework should take place. In addition, as every teacher knows, if homework is not assigned parents will quickly and strongly insist that it be given. Homework is such a part of the education culture, that it is synonymous with the very word schooling. Even though homework is strongly advocated by school boards and professional educational organizations, it is not without its critics, both public and professional. At the public level, there have been scores of editorials, cover stories, and articles in popular magazines such as, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Newsweek, New York Daffy News, Time Magazine, U.S. News and World Report, and The Washington Post. Within the professional world of educational researchers and policy analysts, there have also been serious concerns about the efficacy of homework (see Cooper, 1989, 1994; Epstein and Pinkow, 1988; Gill & Schlossman, 1996; and, Kralovec & Buell, 2000). Teacher, parent, and student opinions about homework abound (Roderique, et al., 1994) however, solid evidence that homework is more or less beneficial for specific populations of students, at specific grade levels, for various subjects, and with different types of homework, is not altogether conclusive (Check & Ziebell, 1980; Cooper, 1989; Epstein, Polloway, Foley, & Patton, 1992; Firth, 1991; Heller, Spooner, Anderson, & Mims, 1989; Hodapp & Hodapp, 1992; and, Salend and Schliff, 1989). The complexity of the homework issue and the inability to have adequate control groups for specific types of research may render efficacy too vague for in depth and comprehensive assessment of homework. Although there is widespread belief by parents and educators alike that homework is beneficial, it is, and has been the source of constant criticism throughout the past hundred years (Kralovec and Buell, 2000). Historically, one of the first to publicly challenge the homework mystique was Edward Bok, Editor of The Ladies Home Journal (1900), who brought criticism of homework into the popular arena by attacking it as an invasion of family time and for being unsupervised and left to the whims of unqualified parents. Burnham (1905), later admonished schools for denying children their right for leisure activities and play. He also declared that the value of homework should be based on data not simply opinions and that differential benefits would depend on the different academic subjects being considered as well as student grade level. In every decade since the early 1900s there have been critics who have attacked and challenged schools for their homework practices and policies. â¦","venue":"","journal":{"name":"Academic exchange quarterly","volume":"7","pages":"71-78"},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Education","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Psychology","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":null,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/38782196a2b485669987eac7e2a3c33503f68d5e"}

{"corpusid":196691820,"title":"Characterization of cis-elements in hormonal stress-responsive genes in Oryza sativa","abstract":"Phytohormones play a key role in plant growth and development. The process of plantâs perception and response to abiotic and biotic stresses is controlled mainly by the phytohormones which act as an endogenous messenger in the regulation of the plantâs status. They can be activated by different signaling pathways in response to environmental stresses. Plants respond to environmental stress through interaction of transcription factors with a handful of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Some examples of cis elements include abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE), G-box (CACGTG) element, and W-box. In order to investigate the effects of different hormonal stresses which have a key role in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice, microarray data was used. Of the available data, 931 genes revealed significant differences in response to different hormonal stresses such as auxin, cytokinin, abcisic acid, ethylene, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid. The present results showed that 388 genes were up-regulated, and 543 genes were down-regulated. Most of the genes were up-regulated in response to Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) hormone. Genes Ontology analysis revealed that they respond to various hormones involved in auxin- responsive genes, auxin-activated signaling pathway and cellular responses to environmental stimuli. G-box had the highest number of cis elements involved in hormonal stress and was regulated by auxin signaling and various stresses. Dehydrin was the only gene up-regulated in response to the six hormones. This gene can be activated in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. As such, dehydrin gene can be used in crop breeding programs to increase tolerance to different environmental stresses in various plant species.","venue":"Asia-Pacific Journal of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology","journal":{"name":"Asia Pacific Journal of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology","volume":null,"pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Biology","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Environmental Science","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Biology","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":null,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/edd0201d87edc3703cd538b9a2dd846072416958"}

Pour cela, nous avons compare trois conditions de marche a savoir : la marche au sol (SOL), celle sur le tapis roulant a vitesse fixe (VF) et enfin celle en mode haptique (MH). \n \nMETHODE : Lâexperimentation a porte sur 15 participants sains au cours de laquelle nous avons evalue quatre parametres spatio-temporels de la marche (la longueur de pas, la longueur de foulee, la cadence et la vitesse de marche) ainsi que leur variabilite. Un systeme de 19 capteurs inertiels (MVN Biomech ; XSens, Inc.) a ete utilise dans trois conditions de marche : la marche naturelle le long dâun couloir, la marche sur tapis roulant a vitesse fixe et enfin la marche sur un tapis roulant en mode haptique. Apres avoir realise les acquisitions, un traitement de donnees a ete effectue faisant suite a une correction des donnees qui avait concerne les participants qui presentaient le plus de variabilite et donc le moins de controle par la meme occasion du tapis en mode haptique. Nous nous sommes dâailleurs limites a huit participants et pris comme situation de reference de la variabilite de la marche : le CV (coefficient de variation) de la longueur de pas allant de 10 a 25 %.

{"corpusid":206965578,"title":"Alcohol Increases Delay and Probability Discounting of Condom-Protected Sex: A Novel Vector for Alcohol-Related HIV Transmission.","abstract":"BACKGROUND\nAlcohol use, especially at binge levels, is associated with sexual HIV risk behavior, but the mechanisms through which alcohol increases sexual risk taking are not well-examined. Delay discounting, that is, devaluation of future consequences as a function of delay to their occurrence, has been implicated in a variety of problem behaviors, including risky sexual behavior. Probability discounting is studied with a similar framework as delay discounting, but is a distinct process in which a consequence is devalued because it is uncertain or probabilistic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-three, nondependent alcohol users (13 male, 10 female; mean ageÂ =Â 25.3Â years old) orally consumed alcohol (1Â g/kg) or placebo in 2 separate experimental sessions. During sessions, participants completed tasks examining delay and probability discounting of hypothetical condom-protected sex (Sexual Delay Discounting Task, Sexual Probability Discounting Task) and of hypothetical and real money.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlcohol decreased the likelihood that participants would wait to have condom-protected sex versus having immediate, unprotected sex. Alcohol also decreased the likelihood that participants would use an immediately available condom given a specified level of sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk. Alcohol did not affect delay discounting of money, but it did increase participants' preferences for larger, probabilistic monetary rewards over smaller, certain rewards.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAcute, binge-level alcohol intoxication may increase sexual HIV risk by decreasing willingness to delay sex in order to acquire a condom inÂ situations where one is not immediately available, and by decreasing sensitivity to perceived risk of STI contraction. These findings suggest that delay and probability discounting are critical, but heretofore unrecognized, processes that may mediate the relations between alcohol use and HIV risk.","venue":"Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research","journal":{"name":"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research","volume":"40 6","pages":"\n          1339-50\n        "},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Medicine","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Psychology","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Psychology","source":"external"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/657a8fca898e82df929b786d9ec23475ccb50e22"}

{"corpusid":209408397,"title":"Combined corneal CXL and photorefractive keratectomy for treatment of keratoconus: a review.","abstract":"Keratoconus and iatrogenic keratectasia are the corneal ectatic disorders occurring due to biomechanical weakening of the cornea resulting in distorted images, myopia, and irregular astigmatism. Corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) is performed to arrest keratoconus successfully. The main aim of this review is to discuss the safety and efficacy of the adjuvant therapies, such as the combination of CXL and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for the treatment of corneal ectatic disorders. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus using keywords 'collagen' 'keratoconus', 'keratectasia', 'collagen cross-linking', and 'photorefractive keratectomy'. Search results were restricted to clinical studies published in English. Corneal CXL effectively arrests the progression of keratoconus by enhancing corneal rigidity. However, functional vision is not improved by cross-linking. Combining CXL to refractive surgeries such as topography-guided PRK or transepithelial PRK is found to be a safe and effective method in providing corneal stability as well as significantly improving functional visual acuity with few minor complications. This combined technique also prevents regression of keratoconus and reduce the risk of keratectasia. CXL combined with PRK is a promising therapeutic approach in ophthalmology that can be successfully used to treat progressive keratoconus and other corneal ectatic disorders and to enhance visual acuity.","venue":"International Journal of Ophthalmology","journal":{"name":"International journal of ophthalmology","volume":"12 12","pages":"\n          1929-1938\n        "},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Medicine","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":2,"scimago_score":0.521,"scimago_h_index":44,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/33ca8bea7a7663a68a4e82c7e8a56f65e5a82f3c"}

An EXSIMO combines model, data and code with the execution environment to run the computational analysis in an automated manner using tools from software engineering. Key components are i) models, data and code for the computational analysis; ii) tests for models, data and code; and iii) an automation layer to run tests and execute the analysis. An EXSIMO combines version control, model, data, units, annotations, analysis, reports, execution environment, testing, continuous integration and release. We applied the concept to perform a replication study of a computational analysis of hepatic glucose metabolism in the liver.

This study is aimed at explaining the determinant of audit quality in the Indonesian context. We hypothesize that the influence of the work experience, auditor ethics, audit tenure, and time budget pressure impact to the audit quality produced by auditors that work in the Public Accountant Firms. The research used questionnaires to collect data with a total sample of 102 respondents. This study uses a quantitative approach and using multiple linear regression analysis. The result of testing the hypothesis stated that work experience, auditor ethics, and audit tenure variables partially influence the quality of the audit. Finally, our results contribute to the regulatory agencies that must make strict rules to ensure auditor compliance on audit tenure, and code of ethics, so that SNP Finance failures cases do not occur in Indonesia.","venue":"Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Inclusive Business in the Changing World","journal":{"name":"Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Inclusive Business in the Changing World","volume":null,"pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Business","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Economics","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Business","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93e24c6e3546233357eb4af63988156dc5fb8703"}

And, is a lab-based test for the Blackett conjecture feasible?","abstract":"According to the Blackett conjecture, any neutral rotating body acquires a magnetic moment proportional to its angular momentum. Using the data on the dipolar magnetic field of Mars, we put a stringent upper limit on the value of the Blackett's constant, the dimensionless constant that relates the magnetic moment to the angular momentum. As a consequence, the Blackett effect cannot directly account for the magnetic fields of celestial bodies and galaxies. We also show that the Blackett effect cannot be tested in a laboratory since the magnetic moment of any rotating lab-scale object would be much smaller than the one produced by the well-known Barnett effect.","venue":"","journal":{"name":"arXiv: General Physics","volume":"","pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Physics","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Physics","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":null,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/818ac690dc3fe563cd33a994ac63f4d41fcb2864"}

{"corpusid":238706261,"title":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the volume of labor migration, employment, and remittances","abstract":"Flows of external labor migration in most cases occur under the influence of\n the internal economic and political situation in the country; however, in\n 2020 these trends changed significantly for reasons which did not depend on\n the socio-economic situation. In order to determine the volume of labor\n migration in 2020, an analysis was conducted. According to the results, it\n has been concluded that, despite the restrictive quarantine measures\n implemented in the European Union (EU) that caused the partial return of\n migrants to their countries, the rise in unemployment and slow economic\n growth, labor migrants are highly employed in key occupations of EU that are\n vital in the fight against coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It has been\n noticed that EU countries increase the number of officially issued residence\n permits to citizens of non-member countries every year, and Ukraine has\n become the absolute leader in the number of received residence permits, as\n well as the leader among European countries by the volume of the received\n remittances. An abstract-logical and systematic approach, analytical,\n comparative, graphical, and critical methods were used in the study.\n Prospects for external labor migration of Ukrainians to European countries\n have been identified.","venue":"Journal of the Geographical Institute Jovan Cvijic, SASA","journal":{"name":"Journal of the Geographical Institute Jovan Cvijic, SASA","volume":null,"pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Economics","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Sociology","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Political Science","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2027dba741aae8ed552e27c655bc1d333715829b"}

{"corpusid":248525724,"title":"Asymmetry in cerebral perfusion from circle of Willis arterial variations in normal population","abstract":"Background Angiographic and cadaveric studies have evidenced variations in the circle of Willis (CoW). Age-related changes in cerebral hemodynamics may be attributable to vascular variations. Objectives The objective is to assess interdependence of completeness of CoW with age using non-invasive MRA and cerebral perfusion using arterial spin labeling (ASL). Methods This single-center, prospective study segregated 189 subjects into three groups: â¤5, 5 to 18, and >18 years. Angiographic (complete CoW and vascular asymmetry index) using TOF and contrast-enhanced- (CE-) MRA, and perfusion (perfusion asymmetry index) data using ASL were obtained. Results One hundred and six (56.08%) subjects showed complete CoW on TOF and 100 (52.91%) on CE-MRA. Anterior and posterior collateral pathways were more prevalent in the younger population. Completeness of CoW decreased with increasing age, group 1 (54/60, 90% TOF; 51/60, 85% CE), group 2 (39/64, 60% TOF; 37/64, 56.92% CE), and group 3 (13/65, 20.31% TOF; 12/65, 18.75% CE); p-value < .0001. A statistically significant decrease in cerebral and cerebellar perfusion with increasing age was seen. Cerebellar to frontal perfusion change was higher in group 1. Fetal posterior cerebral artery (PCA) led to ipsilateral low and contralateral hyperperfusion flow asymmetries between occipital lobes. Conclusions This study shows that a complete CoW is commoner in pediatrics than adults and with increasing age, the completeness of CoW decreases paralleled by decrease in cerebral and cerebellar perfusion. There is age-related shift of perfusion from hindbrain to forebrain and the regression of PCoA occurs with increasing age leading to alterations in cerebral perfusion and hemodynamics.","venue":"The Neuroradiology Journal","journal":{"name":"The Neuroradiology Journal","volume":"36","pages":"31 - 37"},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Medicine","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":false,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/89af714299df0188f9bfec3225ca969cfcb91e42"}
