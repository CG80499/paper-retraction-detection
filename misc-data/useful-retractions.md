Sino-foreign cooperative education is the main means for the country to carry out international education and foreign exchange, and it aims to cultivate complex talents who can adapt to the new international trade and exchange in the world. Due to the special nature of the student source and the complexity of the purpose of the school, the teaching concept and mode of Sino-foreign cooperative schools differ greatly from the traditional general higher education, which also puts forward strict requirements on the professional level of counselors. As an emerging technology, big data mining technology has a unique advantage in optimizing the processing and management of a large amount of data. The application of big data mining technology to the management of counselors in Sino-foreign cooperative education is important for improving the quality of education, establishing an efficient educational model of Sino-foreign cooperative education, and promoting the international modernization of national education.","venue":"Mobile Information Systems","journal":{"name":"Mobile Information Systems","volume":null,"pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":null,"oa_is_retracted":true,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d01ff6c87d184c37191288dca997e133e810b5c"}

### 3 - **Hepatoma Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Promote Liver Cancer Metastasis by Inducing the Differentiation of Bone Marrow Stem Cells Through microRNA-181d-5p and the FAK/Src Pathway**

{"corpusid":235219847,"title":"RETRACTED: Hepatoma Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Promote Liver Cancer Metastasis by Inducing the Differentiation of Bone Marrow Stem Cells Through microRNA-181d-5p and the FAK/Src Pathway","abstract":"Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are beneficial to repair the damaged liver. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) are notorious in tumor metastasis. But the mechanism underlying hepatoma cell-derived EVs in BMSCs and liver cancer remains unclear. We hypothesize that hepatoma cell-derived EVs compromise the effects of BMSCs on the metastasis of liver cancer. The differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) were screened. HepG2 cells were transfected with miR-181d-5p mimic or inhibitor, and the EVs were isolated and incubated with BMSCs to evaluate the differentiation of BMSCs into fibroblasts. Hepatoma cells were cultured with BMSCs conditioned medium (CM) treated with HepG2-EVs to assess the malignant behaviors of hepatoma cells. The downstream genes and pathways of miR-181d-5p were analyzed and their involvement in the effect of EVs on BMSC differentiation was verified through functional rescue experiments. The nude mice were transplanted with BMSCs-CM or BMSCs-CM treated with HepG2-EVs, and then tumor growth and metastasis in vivo were assessed. HepG2-EVs promoted fibroblastic differentiation of BMSCs, and elevated levels of α-SMA, vimentin, and collagen in BMSCs. BMSCs-CM treated with HepG2-EVs stimulated the proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) of hepatoma cells. miR-181d-5p was the most upregulated in HepG2-EVs-treated BMSCs. miR-181d-5p targeted SOCS3 to activate the FAK/Src pathway and SOCS3 overexpression inactivated the FAK/Src pathway. Reduction of miR-181d-5p in HepG2-EVs or SOCS3 overexpression reduced the differentiation of BMSCs into fibroblasts, and compromised the promoting effect of HepG2-EVs-treated BMSCs-CM on hepatoma cells. In vivo, HepG2-EVs-treated BMSCs facilitated liver cancer growth and metastasis. In conclusion, HepG2-EVs promote the differentiation of BMSCs, and promote liver cancer metastasis through the delivery of miR-181d-5p and the SOCS3/FAK/Src pathway.","venue":"Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology","journal":{"name":"Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology","volume":"9","pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Medicine","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Biology","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":true,"scimago_quartile":1,"scimago_score":1.576,"scimago_h_index":103,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73a8e54d004fcabb45c6e58b59126681cc388753"}

### 4 - MicroRNA‐206 upregulation relieves circTCF25‐induced

osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration

Our study aimed to unravel whether circTCF25 dictates cellular activities of osteosarcoma cells and address the possible mechanisms associated with microRNA (miR). circTCF25 and miR-206 in clinical specimens from 25 patients suffering from osteosarcoma were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). circTCF25- or miR-206-overexpressed cells (MG-63 and Saos-2) were constructed by transfection and confirmed by qRT-PCR, and continually subjected to cascades of assays for viability by Cell Counting Kit-8, proliferation by BrdU+ , migration, and invasion by Transwell chamber and proteins involved in proliferation (cyclin D1 and CDK6), migration and invasion (MMPs, TIMP-1, and vimentin) and signaling transduction (mitogen-activated protein kinase [MEK], extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK], protein kinase B [AKT], mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR]) by western blot. Targeting the relationship between miR-206 and circTCF25 was validated by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System. circTCF25 was apparently enriched while miR-206 was deficient in osteosarcoma specimens. circTCF25 elevated viability, facilitated proliferation, and fortified migration and invasion capacities of MG-63 and Saos-2 cells. Besides, miR-206 was downregulated in circTCF25-replenished cells. However, miR-206 upregulation offset the carcinogenesis of circTCF25. miR-206 had the ability to downregulate circTCF25 by targeting it. Of note, circTCF25 drove the phosphorylation of signaling transducers while miR-206 upregulation relived the effect of circTCF25 on the phosphorylation. circTCF25 conferred carcinogenesis in osteosarcoma cells through and suppressing miR-206 expression. However, miR-206 overexpression buffered the carcinogenesis of circTCF25.","venue":"Journal of Cellular Physiology","journal":{"name":"Journal of cellular physiology","volume":null,"pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Medicine","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Biology","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Chemistry","source":"external"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":true,"scimago_quartile":1,"scimago_score":1.321,"scimago_h_index":204,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28222aeb0adc78a641717b87f27b5c117c886ea8"}

Silkscreen printmaking is a type of print with high technology content, strong dependence on media, and no traditional load. Thirty years ago, as soon as silkscreen prints settled in China, they began artistic exploration and experimentation with a brand-new attitude. Several generations of screen print workers have achieved it, expanded it, and made it independent in the fusion of modern language methods and oriental cultural spirit, and in the exploration of screen vocabulary, characteristics and character, it has an independent status and ranks among the international elite qualifications. This paper analyzes the root problems of high-tech printmaking tools, materials, technical principles, and causes of aesthetics. Starting from the background of the concept of green development, it expounds its related concepts, analyzes the theoretical origin of green development, and clearly recognizes the high-tech. The limitation of printmaking in the development space—that is, the expression language of digital plate making, is relatively correct in theory, so as to carry out step-by-step exploration and practice.","venue":"Journal of Environmental and Public Health","journal":{"name":"Journal of Environmental and Public Health","volume":"2022","pages":null},"s2fieldsofstudy":[{"category":"Environmental Science","source":"s2-fos-model"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"oa_is_retracted":true,"scimago_quartile":null,"scimago_score":null,"scimago_h_index":null,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f5eb156e08cb62ead295f2e7eb9cd64acd06ae5"}
